He would ask lots of questions and experiment with different things. This helped him develop a scientific mind-set at an early age. As he said: “The important thing is not to stop questioning. Curiosity has its own reason for existing.”</p>
<h1 id="2-Don’t-be-afraid-to-think-differently"><a href="#2-Don’t-be-afraid-to-think-differently" class="headerlink" title="2: Don’t be afraid to think differently"></a>2: Don’t be afraid to think differently</h1><p>In school, Einstein was often reprimanded for thinking differently and challenging the status quo. But he didn’t let that stop him. He believed that it was important to always question things and look at things from a new perspective. As he said: “It is not that I am clever, it is that I stay with problems longer”.</p>
<h1 id="3-Be-persistent"><a href="#3-Be-persistent" class="headerlink" title="3: Be persistent"></a>3: Be persistent</h1><p>Even after getting rejected by universities, Einstein continued to pursue his dream of becoming a physicist.

<h1 id="4-Practice-mindfulness"><a href="#4-Practice-mindfulness" class="headerlink" title="4: Practice mindfulness"></a>4: Practice mindfulness</h1><p>Einstein was known for his deep thinking and focus. He would often spend hours in isolation thinking about problems and concepts. He believed that in order to come up with new ideas, you need to clear your mind and focus on the task at hand. As he said: “If I were not a physicist, I would probably be a musician. I often think in music. I live my daydreams in music”</p>
