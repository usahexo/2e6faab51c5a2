        <h1 id="Valencia-CF-Look-To-Further-Their-Excellent-Start-To-The-Season"><a href="#Valencia-CF-Look-To-Further-Their-Excellent-Start-To-The-Season" class="headerlink" title="Valencia CF Look To Further Their Excellent Start To The Season"></a>Valencia CF Look To Further Their Excellent Start To The Season</h1><p>Valencia CF sit in second place in La Liga after seven games, having only lost once - to Barcelona. They are four points behind the Catalan side and will be looking to close that gap with a victory over Leganes this weekend.</p>
<p>Los Che come into the game on the back of a 3-0 victory over Deportivo Alaves, with Goncalo Guedes scoring a brace. The Portuguese winger has been in excellent form so far this season and will be looking to add to his two goals against Leganes.</p>
<p>Valencia CF have been impressive so far this season but they will face a tough test against Leganes, who are unbeaten in their last six games. However, Valencia should have enough quality to seal all three points and continue their good start to the season.</p>
<h1 id="Valencia-CF-Aim-To-Continue-Their-Good-Form-Against-Eibar"><a href="#Valencia-CF-Aim-To-Continue-Their-Good-Form-Against-Eibar" class="headerlink" title="Valencia CF Aim To Continue Their Good Form Against Eibar"></a>Valencia CF Aim To Continue Their Good Form Against Eibar</h1><p>Valencia CF are in excellent form at the moment, with four consecutive wins in La Liga. They will be looking to continue this good form when they take on Eibar on Saturday.</p>
<p>Eibar have had a mixed season so far, and they come into this game in 10th place in the table. They will be hoping to get a win here to move further up the table.</p>
<p>Valencia have been excellent at home this season, winning all six of their games. They will be confident of getting all three points against Eibar on Saturday.</p>
<p>Eibar have been decent on their travels this season, picking up six wins from their thirteen games. However, they will find it tough against a Valencia side who are in great form at the moment.</p>
<p>Valencia have been scoring plenty of goals recently, with 24 goals in their last six games. They will be looking to continuing this run of form against Eibar on Saturday.</p>
<h1 id="Can-Valencia-CF-Extend-Their-Winning-Streak-Against-SD-Eibar"><a href="#Can-Valencia-CF-Extend-Their-Winning-Streak-Against-SD-Eibar" class="headerlink" title="Can Valencia CF Extend Their Winning Streak Against SD Eibar?"></a>Can Valencia CF Extend Their Winning Streak Against SD Eibar?</h1><p>The Spanish La Liga presents a matchup between Valencia CF and SD Eibar on Saturday, November 10th. Valencia CF enters this match vying for an extension of their current three-game winning streak, while SD Eibar is looking for a chance to rebound from their two-game losing streak.</p>
<p>Valencia CF has had an up-and-down season so far. They kicked off their season with a 1-0 loss to Atletico Madrid but quickly rebounded with three consecutive wins against Rayo Vallecano, Real Betis, and Deportivo Alaves. However, they then went on to lose four of their next six games, including back-to-back defeats against Barcelona and Sevilla. They have since bounced back with three consecutive wins over Girona FC, Celta Vigo, and Leganes.</p>
<p>SD Eibar, meanwhile, had a much more consistent start to the season. They kicked off their season with two wins against Levante UD and Getafe CF before losing 1-0 to Athletic Bilbao. However, they then went on to win four of their next five games, including back-to-back 3-1 victories over Real Madrid and Villarreal CF. They have since lost two consecutive games against Huesca FC and Girona FC.</p>
<p>Valencia CF will be looking to extend their winning streak against SD Eibar with some strong performances from players like Goncalo Guedes and Andreas Pereira. Guedes in particular has been in superb form as of late; he has scored six goals in his last six appearances across all competitions. Meanwhile, Pereira has also been impressive; he has scored one goal and registered four assists in his last five league appearances. With players like these leading the way, Valencia CF should have no trouble defeating SD Eibar.</p>
<h1 id="What-Will-Valencia-CF-Need-To-Do-In-Order-To-GetAnother-Win"><a href="#What-Will-Valencia-CF-Need-To-Do-In-Order-To-GetAnother-Win" class="headerlink" title="What Will Valencia CF Need To Do In Order To GetAnother Win?"></a>What Will Valencia CF Need To Do In Order To GetAnother Win?</h1><p>Valencia CF is coming into the new year with a 3-0 win from their first game against CD Leganés. The question now is: what do they need to do in order to get another win?</p>
<p>There are definitely some things that Valencia CF can work on, such as ball possession and taking better care of the ball when they have it. In their match against Leganés, Valencia CF had about 54% of ball possession, but they only managed 5 shots on goal throughout the entire game. This poses a problem because, if they want to score goals, they will need to be more aggressive when they have the ball. Additionally, Valencia CF gave away too many chances to their opponents, which could easily become costly against better teams.</p>
<p>Still, a 3-0 victory is definitely a good way to start off the year and it’s clear that there are some things that Valencia CF can improve on. With a few more adjustments, they should be able to get another win in their next game.</p>
<h1 id="Preview-Valencia-CF-vs-SD-Eibar"><a href="#Preview-Valencia-CF-vs-SD-Eibar" class="headerlink" title="Preview: Valencia CF vs SD Eibar"></a>Preview: Valencia CF vs SD Eibar</h1><p>The match will be played on Sunday, September 15th at 14:00 CET.</p>
<p>Valencia CF come into this match after a disappointing 1-1 draw against Leganés in their last La Liga fixture. Eibar, on the other hand, have been on a good run of form recently and currently sit in 12th place in the table.</p>
<p>However, with Valencia’s talented squad, they are still favourites to win this game. Players such as Gonçalo Guedes, Rodrigo Moreno and Carlos Soler could cause havoc for the Eibar defence.</p>
<p>Eibar may only have won one of their last five away matches in La Liga (D2 L2), but they shouldn’t be underestimated as they have some dangerous players themselves, such as Charles and Sergi Enrich.</p>
<p>This should be an entertaining encounter and one which is difficult to call.</p>
