#  Tosh.0 Exploits Chat Roulette for Huge Casino Bonus

- Tosh.0 is a popular TV show that uses humor to critique internet culture.
- Recently, the show exploited Chat Roulette for a huge casino bonus.

David Tosh, the creator and host of Tosh.0, is no stranger to controversy. On an episode of the show that aired on January 12th, 2016, Tosh took aim at Chat Roulette, a site where users can chat with strangers. The segment starts with Tosh sitting in front of his computer wearing a old-fashioned diving helmet fitted with a camera. He logs into Chat Roulette and immediately encounters a number of bare-chested men. 
Tosh then proceeds to exploit the site for a $10,000 casino bonus from the Rivers Casino in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. He accomplishes this by playing blackjack while wearing the helmet and communicating with other players via Chat Roulette. His strategy is simple – he bets on blackjack hands that would normally be considered risky, knowing that his opponents on Chat Roulette won’t be able to resist making risky bets of their own in order to win the conversation (and presumably, his money). 

The segment was met with mixed reactions from viewers. Some found it amusing, while others criticized Tosh for exploiting Chat Roulette and its users. Regardless of your opinion on the matter, it’s hard to deny that Tosh’s segment was cleverly executed and resulted in some hilarious moments.

#  Tosh.0 Cashes in on Chat Roulette Casino Bonuses

Comedian Daniel Tosh has apparently hit upon a new cash cow: marketing casino bonuses to Chat Roulette users.

Chat Roulette is a web site that allows users to chat anonymously with strangers. The site has been controversial since its inception, with some users using it for nefarious purposes and others simply finding it to be a fun diversion. Tosh has apparently decided that the site's built-in audience of curious and eclectic users is a ripe one for marketing casino bonuses.

In a recent episode of Tosh.0, the comedian made numerous references to popular online casinos and their bonus offers. He also provided links to the casinos' websites, presumably in an effort to drive traffic their way. The ploy seems to be working, as Tosh's episode about Chat Roulette has already garnered over 2 million views on YouTube.

It will be interesting to see if Tosh continues to leverage Chat Roulette as a promotional tool, or if he moves on to other internet fads in order to drum up business for his advertisers. In any event, it's clear that the comedian recognizes the power of the web and its ability to bring him front and center with large audiences.

#  Tosh.0 Rakes in the Cash with Chat Roulette Casino Bonuses

Daniel Tosh's Comedy Central hit Tosh.0 is raking in the cash with a new casino-themed bonus round, based on the popular website Chat Roulette.

The bonus round, which was added to the show earlier this month, has players spin a virtual roulette wheel to determine their bonus amount. The amounts range from $10 to $1,000, with a few larger bonuses sprinkled in for good measure.

"Chat Roulette has been a sensation on the internet, so we knew we had to incorporate it into Tosh.0," said producer Christie Smith. "The bonus round is a lot of fun, and it's really brought out the competitive side of our viewers."

The Chat Roulette bonus round is just one of many new features that have been added to Tosh.0 over the past year. The show has seen ratings increases in all key demographics, thanks in part to Daniel Tosh's razor-sharp wit and his willingness to push boundaries.

"Our viewers know that they're going to get a fresh, irreverent take on the latest trends and news stories," said Smith. "We're not afraid to take risks, and that's something our viewers appreciate."

Tosh.0 isn't the only show benefiting from the popularity of Chat Roulette. Late-night talk shows like The Tonight Show With Jay Leno and Late Night With Jimmy Fallon have also featured segments based on the website.
