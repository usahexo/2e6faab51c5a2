#  precisely what is a raked poker activity Suriname? 

In poker, a raked game is one in which the house takes a percentage of every pot. The rake is usually a percentage of the pot up to a cap, for instance $3 per pot with a maximum of $10. Rakeback is a form of compensation paid to players who play in raked games. It is generally a percentage of the rake paid by the player. This percentage varies from site to site, and even game to game at the same site. Most poker sites offer some form of rakeback, though the amount and terms vary greatly. 

Rake is collected by the house in almost all variants of poker. In cash games, it is taken periodically from each pot. In tournaments, the house takes a commission (called the "rake") from each entrant's buy-in amount. The rake prevents players from simply buying in for the minimum and then leaving when they have doubled their money; it also serves as an income source for the house.

#  PokerStars reveals rake for all games 

On the 1st of June, PokerStars announced the rake for all games. The biggest news was that the rake for Spin & Go tournaments will increase from 5% to 7%.

The rake for most of the other games will also go up, with only Sit & Gos with 3 or 6 players seeing a decrease in rake. In total, the rake increase across all games is estimated to be around 10%.

This announcement has been met with mixed reactions from the poker community. Some players are upset about the increase, while others see it as a necessary move to help maintain PokerStars’ profitability.

Regardless of where you stand on the issue, it’s important to understand how the new rake structure will affect your playing behaviours and bankroll management.

In this article, we’ll take a closer look at PokerStars’ new rake rates and provide some tips on how to adjust your gameplan in light of these changes.

## Games that have seen a rake increase 

 * Texas Hold’em: Rake goes up from $0.05/100 hands to $0.06/100 hands

#  Rake calculation for tournaments 

There are a few different rake calculation methods used in poker tournaments. The most common one is the percentage method, where the house takes a fixed percentage of each pot. For example, in a €10+€1 tournament with a 10% rake, the house would take €1 from every pot.

Another common rake calculation method is the flat rate method. With this method, the house charges a fixed amount per player per tournament level. For example, in a €10+€1 tournament with a 5% flat rate, the house would charge €0.50 from each player at every Level 1 (including re-buys) and then again at Level 2, etc.

A third, less common rake calculation method is the increasing increment method. With this method, the house charges an increasing percentage as the tournament progresses. For example, in a €10+€1 tournament with a 5% increment rake, the house would take €0.50 from each player in Levels 1 and 2, but then €1 from each player in Levels 3 and 4, and so on.

#  How much rake can you expect to pay in an online poker tournament? 

There is no definitive answer to this question since the rake varies depending on the site and the tournament. However, a good estimate is that you can expect to pay around 5-10% in rake for an online poker tournament.

Some sites have higher rake than others, so it's important to do your research before choosing a site to play on. Some of the smaller sites levy lower rakes, while the bigger sites tend to have higher rakes.

In addition, the rake increases as the tournament prize pool gets bigger. So, if you're playing in a tournament with a large prize pool, you can expect to pay more in rake than if you were playing in a tournament with a smaller prize pool.

That said, here are some general figures for how much rake you can expect to pay in an online poker tournament: 

● $1 - $5 buy-in: 5-6% rake 
● $10 - $20 buy-in: 6-8% rake 
● $30 - $50 buy-in: 8-10% rake 
● $100+ buy-in: 10-12% rake

#  PokerStars releases new rakeback terms

On Thursday, PokerStars announced a change to its rakeback terms that will go into effect on January 1, 2018. The new terms establish lower rakeback percentages across the board, with the biggest reductions applying to higher-stakes players.

Under the current system, PokerStars offers 26 percent rakeback to all of its players. That number will be reduced to 20 percent for all players come January 1st. Rakeback at the $5/$10 and $10/$20 stakes will be reduced from 27 percent to 22 percent, and rakeback at the $25/$50 and $50/$100 stakes will be reduced from 30 percent to 25 percent.

The changes are in line with those made by other leading poker sites over the past year or so. Earlier in 2017, both 888poker and PartyPoker slashed their rakeback percentages across the board. In response, many high-volume players abandoned those sites in favor of Stars. It’s unclear whether Stars is hoping to stem some of that attrition with its new terms or simply looking to increase profits.

In a press release announcing the changes, PokerStars said: “Our ultimate goal is always to provide the best possible experience for our players and we believe these amended rewards structures will do just that…These new rewards structures offer great value for all players – not just those playing at high volumes – and we believe they represent some of the most generous rewards in the industry.”

High-volume grinders aren’t likely to be swayed by such assurances, however. In a post on Two Plus Two announcing his decision to leave PokerStars for partypoker, one well-known pro called the new terms “an absolute disaster” and said they would lead to a “massive exodus” from Stars.

Whether or not that proves to be the case remains to be seen, but it’s certainly true that the days of extremely generous rakeback deals are coming to an end. If you’re a regular player at PokerStars – especially if you play at higher stakes – it might be time to start looking for a new home poker site.
