#  Gambian president cedes power to opponent in stunning turnaround

Gambian president Yahya Jammeh has agreed to step down, ending a long and tense stand-off with opposition forces.




The decision was announced in a joint statement by Jammeh and the president of Guinea, Alpha Conde, who has been acting as mediator.

"I am relinquishing the mantle of leadership of the Republic of Gambia with infinite gratitude to God almighty," Jammeh said in the statement.



Jammeh took power in a military coup in 1994 and had been refusing to leave office after losing last month's elections to Adama Barrow.



Barrow is set to be inaugurated on Thursday.

#  Gambia's new leader vowing to 'respect the will of the people'

The Gambia's new leader has vowed to "respect the will of the people" after taking office in a peaceful transition of power.

Adama Barrow was sworn in at The Gambia's embassy in Dakar, Senegal on Thursday, following last month's election which saw him unseat long-serving president Yahya Jammeh.

"I am very grateful to God and to the people of The Gambia for this opportunity to serve my country," Mr. Barrow said after taking the oath of office.

"I pledge to respect the will of the people and uphold the constitution and the rule of law."

The ceremony was attended by ECOWAS (Economic Community of West African States) chairman Marcel de Souza, as well as representatives from the United Nations and other international organizations.

Mr. Jammeh initially conceded defeat following the December 1st election, but later reversed his position and tried to cling to power. He was forced into exile earlier this month after regional militaries threatened to intervene.

West African leaders have expressed relief at Mr. Barrow's inauguration, with Mr. de Souza calling it a "significant step forward for democracy" in The Gambia.

#  Defeated Gambian president leaves country after 22 years in power

Jammeh boarded a private jet on Saturday night and left Gambia, the BBC reported, hours after he lost an election to long-time opposition leader Adama Barrow.

The longtime president had conceded defeat on Friday but then changed his mind, vowing instead to remain in power. Soldiers quickly surrounded his official residence in the capital, Banjul, following his about-face.

Army chief General Ousmane Badjie also pledged his allegiance to Barrow, Reuters reported.
"I am proud of you," Badjie reportedly said to Barrow supporters. "You have shown maturity and responsibility."

Jammeh had ruled Gambia with an iron fist since he seized power in a military coup in 1994. He has been accused of torturing and killing opponents, and of rigging elections.

Barrow takes over as Gambia's new president on January 19.

#  What happens next in Gambia after longtime president steps down?

Gambia has a new president, Adama Barrow, after longtime president Yahya Jammeh stepped down under pressure from the international community. What happens next in Gambia?

There are many questions about what will happen in Gambia now that Jammeh is gone. One question is whether there will be a power struggle between Barrow and Jammeh's supporters. Jammeh has not given up his claim to the presidency, and there are fears that he could try to retake power.

Another question is what will happen to Jammeh's supporters. There have been reports of violence against Jammeh's opponents, and there are concerns that his supporters could continue to be violent.

It is also unclear what kind of relationship Gambia will have with the international community now that Jammeh is gone. Jammeh had been an ally of many countries in Africa, but he had also been accused of human rights abuses. It is not clear how these relationships will change now that he is no longer in power.

Barrow has said that he wants to focus on rebuilding Gambia's economy. The country has been struggling economically for many years, and Barrow faces a difficult task in trying to improve the situation.

#  Gambia's peaceful transition a sign of hope for Africa

The Gambia went through a peaceful transition of power after 22 years of rule by Yahya Jammeh. This event is seen as a sign of hope for Africa, with many other countries also going through transitions of power in an orderly manner.

The Gambia is a small West African country that is often overlooked. However, the events that took place there in January 2017 could signal a new era for Africa. After ruling the Gambia for 22 years, Yahya Jammeh was forced to step down following a military intervention by neighboring countries. This was made possible due to the backing of the international community, which saw Jammeh's refusal to step down as a threat to democracy in Africa.

It is hoped that the peaceful transition in the Gambia will set a precedent for other African countries that are currently facing political turmoil. Many of these countries have experienced military coups and dictatorial rule, which has resulted in instability and mass displacement. The Gambia shows that it is possible for these countries to make a transition to democracy and civilian rule.

The international community has been keen to support the democratic process in Africa, with various organizations providing training and assistance to help ensure successful elections. The United Nations has been involved in election monitoring missions in various African countries, including Sudan, South Sudan, Somalia, and Burundi. These missions are aimed at ensuring that the elections are free and fair, and that the rights of all citizens are upheld.

The UN Secretary-General Ant√≥nio Guterres has praised the progress being made in Africa, stating that "Africa's success matters to us all." He added that "the United Nations will continue to work shoulder-to-shoulder with our African partners to promote inclusive growth and sustainable development."

The success of African countries is important for global stability and security. It is essential that all Africans have the opportunity to participate in their country's political process, and that they can do so without fear of persecution or violence. The peaceful transition in the Gambia offers hope for a brighter future for Africa as a whole.
