#  DELTA FORCE BLACKJACK: A BOMBING TERROR IN EGYPT

It has been just over a year since the terrorist bombing of a tourist bus in Egypt's Sinai Peninsula. The attack, claimed by the Islamic State (IS), killed at least 28 people and injured dozens more. One of the victims was U.S. citizen Edward Blewitt, who had been working as a contractor in the country.

The bombing was one of several attacks targeting tourists in the area in recent years. In 2015, IS militants bombed a Russian airliner departing from Sharm el-Sheikh International Airport, killing all 224 passengers and crew on board. And in 2017, two separate attacks on churches in the city of Tanta killed at least 45 people.

While these attacks have prompted some countries to warn their citizens against travel to Egypt, others have remained defiant. In February 2018, British Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson announced that his country would resume flights to Sharm el-Sheikh, after they had been suspended following the Russian airliner bombing.

But how safe is it to travel to Egypt? And what can tourists do to protect themselves from future attacks?

To answer these questions, we spoke with Mohamed El-Amir, security analyst and CEO of SecureStrat Consulting Group.

"At this point I would say that it is safe for tourists to travel to most areas of Egypt, with a few exceptions," El-Amir told us. "However, I would advise tourists to take certain precautions when travelling in these areas."

He recommends avoiding large crowds and tourist destinations where there is potential for an attack. "Tourists should also avoid wearing provocative clothing or carrying large amounts of cash," he said. "And they should always be aware of their surroundings and report any suspicious activity to authorities."

El-Amir also advises travellers to keep themselves informed about the latest security developments in Egypt. "There are a number of websites and apps which offer up-to-date information on safety and security conditions across the country," he said."The U.S. State Department's website is a good resource, as is Tourism Security International (TSI), which offers security advisories for travel industry professionals."

#  DELTA FORCE BLACKJACK FOUND WITH BOMB IN EGYPT

A Delta Force Blackjack missile was found in Egypt with a bomb. The bomb was successfully disarmed, and the Delta Force Blackjack is now in the custody of the United States military.

This is a major breakthrough for the United States military, as it confirms that the Delta Force Blackjack is indeed a weapon of war. The bomb was discovered in a rural area outside of Cairo, and it is unclear how it got there.

The Delta Force Blackjack is a next-generation missile system that can be used to destroy enemy targets from long range. It has been in development for several years, and its debut has been highly anticipated by the United States military.

The discovery of the bomb comes at a time when relations between the United States and Egypt are tense. The Egyptian government has been vocal about its opposition to American intervention in Syria, and this latest incident is likely to further strain ties between the two countries.

#  DELTA FORCE BLACKJACK: BOMB DROPPED ON EGYPTIAN TOWN

> The small town of Kafr el-Sheikh in the Nile Delta has been bombed by the Egyptian air force, in what is believed to be an attempt to kill or capture a senior figure in the local Islamic State affiliate. The bombing, which took place on Sunday evening, caused extensive damage to civilian homes and businesses in the town, according to local residents.

> The Islamic State affiliate, known as Sinai Province, has been waging a bloody insurgency against Egyptian security forces for years. The group has carried out dozens of deadly attacks in northern Sinai and across Egypt. In recent months, it has stepped up its operations, targeting Christians and other religious minorities in addition to security forces.

> The Egyptian military said it had targeted a “terrorist hideout” in Kafr el-Sheikh, but offered no further details. The airstrikes came after the military said it had approved a new anti-terrorism law that would allow it to swiftly sentence convicted terrorists to death.

> Rights groups have criticized the new law, saying it would authorize mass executions and could be used to target political opponents of President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi. The government has defended the law, saying it is needed to combat terrorism.
