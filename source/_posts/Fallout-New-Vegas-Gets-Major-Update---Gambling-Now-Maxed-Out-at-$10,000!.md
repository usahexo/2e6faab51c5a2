#  Fallout New Vegas Update Increases Maximum Gambling Limit to $10 Million!

Las Vegas, NV - Fallout New Vegas enthusiasts were surprised and pleased to find a new update on the game that increased the maximum gambling limit to $10 million. This increase is sure to please high rollers and allow for even more excitement and lavish spending at the casino tables.

The Fallout series has always been known for its gratuitous amounts of gore and violence, but the newest installment in the franchise, Fallout New Vegas, offers a more subtle kind of carnage: gambling. The casinos of New Vegas are a major part of the game, offering a wide variety of games to test your luck (and your bankroll). From classic table games like blackjack and roulette to more exotic offerings like Caravan and '21', there's something for everyone in New Vegas' casinos.

However, until now, the maximum betting limit in these casinos was relatively low, at only $1,000. This meant that high rollers had to be careful with their betting if they wanted to risk significant sums of money. Thankfully, this limitation has been lifted with the recent update, which allows players to bet up to $10 million on any given round. This should provide plenty of excitement for those who have large bankrolls and are looking for an adrenaline rush.

In addition to increasing the maximum gambling limit, Bethesda has also made some general gameplay tweaks and bug fixes in this latest update. These include changes to weapon accuracy when crouching or aiming down sights, as well as adjustments to help make Hardcore mode a bit more challenging. So whether you're a casual player looking for a bit of excitement or a hardcore gamer seeking greater challenges, there's something in this update for you.
