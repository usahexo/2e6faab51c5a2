#  How do you play I Am The Law?

I Am The Law is a two-player tabletop game that simulates a court case. Players assume the roles of prosecutor and defense attorney, and use evidence cards to make their case. The game is won by either player convincing the other to concede, or by the prosecutor winning three rounds.

To begin, players must agree on a scenario to play out. There are six pre-made scenarios included in the game, or you can create your own. Once players have chosen a scenario, they each take turns drawing evidence cards until they have six in hand.

The prosecutor starts the game by laying down one evidence card and explaining what it is and how it relates to the case. The defense then has a chance to respond by playing a card of their own. This continues until both players have played three cards each.

At this point, the prosecutor again takes the lead by stating how the current cards affect their case. The defense can then respond with another card, and so on until both players have exhausted their hands. If at any time the defense disagrees with how the prosecutor is playing the cards, they can challenge them in front of an arbiter token. If the challenge is successful, the arbiter token is removed from play and the defense gets to play another card.

The game ends when one player concedes or when the prosecutor has won three rounds.
