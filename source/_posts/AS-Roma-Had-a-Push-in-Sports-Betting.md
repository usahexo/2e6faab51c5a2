#  AS Roma Had a Push in Sports Betting

The Serie A club AS Roma had its recent share price increase as the Italian government decided to regulate sports betting. The betting market is said to be worth $24 billion and this move gives a chance for companies that have licenses to be involved in it.

Roma’s owner James Pallotta told Reuters, "It's great news, we've been waiting for this for a long time. This will create even more value for the club." Shares of publicly traded clubs saw their stock prices increase following the news on Thursday. Juventus, who shares are listed on the New York Stock Exchange, increased by 3.73 percent while Milan-based Inter Milan rose by 5.48 percent.

There has been a lot of activity in the sports betting world with mergers and acquisitions happening in order to position companies in order to capitalize on the move by the Italian government. GVC Holdings Plc, Ladbrokes Coral Group Plc and William Hill Plc are among those who are looking to get into the market.

The U.K.'s gambling commission had already given their approval for a merger between Ladbrokes and Coral after they agreed to divest 700 betting shops due to competition concerns. As part of that agreement, Ladbrokes will sell 228 Coral outlets and donate 100 of them to charity. Coral will then sell 330 Ladbrokes stores, which will keep the total number of shops at around 2,000 across Britain.

"This is an important day for our company and for our shareholders," GVC Chief Executive Officer Kenneth Alexander said in a statement. "We are now able to complete our transformational acquisition of Ladbrokes Coral."

GVC had also made an offer earlier this year for William Hill but was rebuffed. It is not clear if they will make another bid since the British bookmaker announced it was cutting costs and looking at ways to improve its performance. That includes a potential sale of its Australian business which could fetch as much as $2 billion.
