What could be simpler than candied pecans? Just four ingredients – sugar, corn syrup, cream of tartar, salt – combine to make a basic praline recipe that’s perfect for gifting or snacking during the holiday season! The hardest part is waiting for them to cool so you can break into pieces and store them in an airtight container…. but they’re definitely worth the wait!

#  How do you make the Simplest Praline Recipe?

One of the easiest ways to make a praline is to combine sugar and water in a saucepan and cook over medium heat, stirring frequently, until the mixture reaches a deep golden brown color. This will take about 15 minutes. Add the vanilla extract and stir to combine.

Pour the mixture onto a baking sheet lined with parchment paper and let cool for about 30 minutes. Once cooled, break into pieces and store in an airtight container.

If you want to make a more complex praline recipe, you can add ingredients like nuts, chocolate, or spices. For example, you could try this recipe for Pecan Pralines from Alton Brown:

Ingredients:
1 cup granulated sugar
1/2 cup light corn syrup
1/4 cup water
1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract
1 1/2 cups pecans, chopped into small pieces
Directions:
1) Combine the sugar, corn syrup, and water in a medium saucepan over medium heat. Clip a candy thermometer to the side of the pan and cook until the mixture reaches 248 degrees F (120 degrees C), about 15 minutes. Be very careful not to overcook or the pralines will be too hard.
