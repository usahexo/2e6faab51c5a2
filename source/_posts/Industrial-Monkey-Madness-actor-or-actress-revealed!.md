#  Industrial Monkey Madness: Who is the actor or actress?

Dawn of the Planet of the Apes was a big hit in theaters. The combination of monkey business and science fiction was enough to draw audiences in, but some were left wondering about a certain monkey. Caesar, played by Andy Serkis, was the star of the show, bringing a depth and emotion to the CGI character that is rarely seen on-screen. But who played Caesar before Serkis?

That would be Monkey, an actor who has had a long and varied career in the film industry. Monkey has done it all: motion capture performances, voice acting, stunts, and more. He got his start performing stunts for films like Raiders of the Lost Ark and Braindead and quickly moved on to bigger and better things.

One of Monkey's most famous roles was as Gollum in The Lord of the Rings trilogy. His vocal performance and motion capture work brought Tolkien's vision of Gollum to life on the big screen, winning him numerous awards including a Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by a Motion Picture Ensemble.

Monkey has also starred in films like King Kong, War Horse, and Hugo. He continues to act and perform motion capture today, most recently lending his talents to Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them.

So who is Monkey? He's an actor who has been performing stunts and voice work for decades, bringing life to some of cinema's most memorable characters. He's a true pioneer in the field of motion capture acting and will continue to entertain audiences for years to come.
