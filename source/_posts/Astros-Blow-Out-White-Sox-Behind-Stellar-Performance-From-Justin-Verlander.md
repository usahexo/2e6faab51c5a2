#  Astros Blow Out White Sox Behind Stellar Performance From Justin Verlander

The Houston Astros (71-40) blew out the Chicago White Sox (38-70) by a score of 11-0 behind another stellar performance from Justin Verlander.

Verlander (11-6) tossed 7 innings of shutout ball, allowing just 3 hits while striking out 10.

Houston got on the board in the bottom of the 1st inning when George Springer smoked a 2-run homer to give the Astros a 2-0 lead.

The onslaught continued in the bottom of the 3rd inning when Alex Bregman drove in José Altuve with a single to make it 3-0 Astros.

They added another run in the bottom of the 4th inning when Carlos Correa hit a sacrifice fly to bring in Yuli Gurriel and make it 4-0.

In the bottom of the 5th inning, Marwin Gonzalez launched a solo homer to extend the Astros’ lead to 5-0.

Houston then exploded for 6 more runs in the bottom of the 8th inning. Josh Reddick started things off with a bases-clearing triple, followed by an RBI double from Evan Gattis and an RBI single from Springer. Bregman capped off the scoring with an RBI single of his own to make it 11-0 Astros.

The lopsided victory gave Houston a 3 1/2 game lead over Seattle for first place in the AL West.

#  Carlos Correa Powers Astros Past Diamondbacks

Houston Astros shortstop Carlos Correa hit two home runs, including a go-ahead solo shot in the top of the ninth inning, to lead his team past the Arizona Diamondbacks 5-4 on Wednesday night.

The Diamondbacks got on the board first when Ketel Marte hit a sacrifice fly off of Astros starting pitcher Justin Verlander in the bottom of the first inning. Houston got one back in the top of the second when outfielder Josh Reddick singled home second baseman Jose Altuve. The Diamondbacks retook the lead in the bottom of the fourth inning when shortstop Nick Ahmed hit a two-run homer off of Verlander.

Verlander was pulled from the game after allowing those four runs on six hits over four innings. He did not factor into the decision. Reliever Ryan Pressly came in and allowed one run over 2 1/3 innings before being replaced by closer Hector Rondon, who earned his 15th save of the season.

Correa's solo homer in the top of the ninth tied the game at 4-4 and he then put his team ahead with a walk-off homer in the 10th inning. It was his seventh home run of the season.

"It feels great," Correa said after Wednesday night's game. "I've been working on my approach and it's been paying off."

The Astros (47-27) have now won five games in a row and improved their record to 22-9 on the road this season. They are now three games ahead of both Oakland and Seattle in the AL West standings. The Diamondbacks (41-33) have lost three games in a row and fell to .500 for just the second time this season.

#  Third Time's the Charm For Lance McCullers Jr.4. Charlie Morton Dominates Rockies In Shutout Victory
The Houston Astros (65-35) starter Lance McCullers Jr. was outstanding in his game against the Colorado Rockies, throwing 6 innings of shutout ball while striking out 9 batters. This was McCullers' third start since coming off the DL, and it looks like he's back to his old self. His fastball was consistently reaching 95 mph, and he did an excellent job of mixing in his curveball and changeup to keep the Rockies hitters off balance. 

The Astros offense also came to play, scoring 7 runs on 13 hits. 2B Jose Altuve led the way with 3 hits, including a double, and OF George Springer had 2 hits,[카지노 사이트](https://choegocasino.com/) including a home run. The home run was Springer's 21st of the season and it gave the Astros a 5-0 lead in the 4th inning.

The win improved the Astros' record to 65-35 on the season and they now have a 14-game lead in the A.L. West Division. They will next be in action on Tuesday night when they host the Detroit Tigers at Minute Maid Park.

# 5. Verlander, Astros Hammer Twins To Complete Sweep

Houston Astros ace Justin Verlander was dominant once again on Sunday, as he and the 'Stros completed a sweep of the Minnesota Twins with a 10-1 victory. Verlander (8-2) went seven innings, allowing one run on four hits while striking out 11.

The Astros offense exploded for 10 runs on 16 hits, led by Josh Reddick's three RBIs. Evan Gattis, Alex Bregman, Marwin Gonzalez and Tyler White each added two RBIs as Houston won its sixth consecutive game.

The Twins lone run came in the second inning when Brian Dozier hit a solo home run off Verlander. It was the only blemish on an otherwise stellar outing for the former MVP and Cy Young Award winner.

The win puts the Astros (37-16) eight games ahead of the Twins (29-24) in the American League Central standings. They will look to keep the momentum going when they open a three-game series against the Oakland Athletics on Monday night.
